              The standardization of plant names is a critical step in various fields of biology, including biodiversity, biogeography, and vegetation research. The WorldFlora package is introduced here to help achieve this goal by matching lists of plant names with a static copy from World Flora Online (WFO), an ongoing global effort to complete an online flora of all known vascular plants and bryophytes by 2020.
            
            
              Methods and Results
              Based on direct and fuzzy matching, WorldFlora inserts matching cases from the WFO to a submitted data set containing taxonomic names. The results and success rates for selecting the expected best single matches are presented for four data sets, including two data sets used in recent comparisons of software tools for correcting taxon names.
            
            
              Conclusions
              WorldFlora offers a straightforward pipeline for semi‐automatic plant name checking. For the four data sets, the success rate of credible matches ranged from 94.7\% to 99.9\%.},

We took advantage of rate-constant rDNA sequence evolution and an “external” calibration using paleoclimatic and fossil data to determine the maximum age and minimum diversification rate of the Hawaiian silversword alliance (Compositae), a textbook example of insular adaptive radiation in plants. Our maximum-age estimate of 5.2 ± 0.8 million years ago for the most recent common ancestor of the silversword alliance is much younger than ages calculated by other means for the Hawaiian drosophilids, lobelioids, and honeycreepers and falls approximately within the history of the modern high islands (≤5.1 ± 0.2 million years ago). By using a statistically efficient estimator that reduces error variance by incorporating clock-based estimates of divergence times, a minimum diversification rate for the silversword alliance was estimated to be 0.56 ± 0.17 species per million years. This exceeds average rates of more ancient continental radiations and is comparable to peak rates in taxa with sufficiently rich fossil records that changes in diversification rate can be reconstructed.},

All evolutionary rate estimates, including rates of molecular evolution, trait evolution, and lineage diversification, share a similar scaling pattern with time: The highest rates are those measured over the shortest time interval. This creates a disconnect between micro- and macroevolution, although the pattern is the opposite of what some might expect: Patterns of change over short timescales predict that evolution has tremendous potential to create variation and that potential is barely tapped by macroevolution. In this review, we discuss this shared scaling pattern across evolutionary rates. We break down possible explanations for scaling into two categories, estimation error and model misspecification, and discuss how both apply to each type of rate. We also discuss the consequences of this ubiquitous pattern, which can lead to unexpected results when comparing ratesover different timescales. Finally, after addressing purely statistical concerns, we explore a few possibilities for a shared unifying explanation across the three types of rates that results from a failure to fully understand and account for how biological processes scale over time.},

	abstract = {The endemic Hawaiian lobeliads are exceptionally species rich and exhibit striking diversity in habitat, growth form, pollination biology and seed dispersal, but their origins and pattern of diversification remain shrouded in mystery. Up to five independent colonizations have been proposed based on morphological differences among extant taxa. We present a molecular phylogeny showing that the Hawaiian lobeliads are the product of one immigration event; that they are the largest plant clade on any single oceanic island or archipelago; that their ancestor arrived roughly 13 Myr ago; and that this ancestor was most likely woody, wind-dispersed, bird-pollinated, and adapted to open habitats at mid-elevations. Invasion of closed tropical forests is associated with evolution of fleshy fruits. Limited dispersal of such fruits in wet-forest understoreys appears to have accelerated speciation and led to a series of parallel adaptive radiations in
              Cyanea
              , with most species restricted to single islands. Consistency of

              Cyanea
              saturates in less than 1.5 Myr. Lobeliad diversity appears to reflect a hierarchical adaptive radiation in habitat, then elevation and flower-tube length, and provides important insights into the pattern and tempo of diversification in a species-rich clade of tropical plants.},

            Identifying along which lineages shifts in diversification rates occur is a central goal of comparative phylogenetics; these shifts may coincide with key evolutionary events such as the development of novel morphological characters, the acquisition of adaptive traits, polyploidization or other structural genomic changes, or dispersal to a new habitat and subsequent increase in environmental niche space. However, while multiple methods now exist to estimate diversification rates and identify shifts using phylogenetic topologies, the appropriate use and accuracy of these methods are hotly debated. Here we test whether five Bayesian methods—Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary Mixtures (BAMM), two implementations of the Lineage-Specific Birth–Death–Shift model (LSBDS and PESTO), the approximate Multi-Type Birth–Death model (MTBD; implemented in BEAST2), and the Cladogenetic Diversification Rate Shift model (ClaDS2)—produce comparable results. We apply each of these methods to a set of 65 empirical time-calibrated phylogenies and compare inferences of speciation rate, extinction rate, and net diversification rate. We find that the five methods often infer different speciation, extinction, and net-diversification rates. Consequently, these different estimates may lead to different interpretations of the macroevolutionary dynamics. The different estimates can be attributed to fundamental differences among the compared models. Therefore, the inference of shifts in diversification rates is strongly method dependent. We advise biologists to apply multiple methods to test the robustness of the conclusions or to carefully select the method based on the validity of the underlying model assumptions to their particular empirical system.},

            Bayesian phylogenetic inference requires a tree prior, which models the underlying diversification process that gives rise to the phylogeny. Existing birth–death diversification models include a wide range of features, for instance, lineage-specific variations in speciation and extinction (SSE) rates. While across-lineage variation in SSE rates is widespread in empirical datasets, few heterogeneous rate models have been implemented as tree priors for Bayesian phylogenetic inference. As a consequence, rate heterogeneity is typically ignored when reconstructing phylogenies, and rate heterogeneity is usually investigated on fixed trees. In this paper, we present a new BEAST2 package implementing the cladogenetic diversification rate shift (ClaDS) model as a tree prior. ClaDS is a birth–death diversification model designed to capture small progressive variations in birth and death rates along a phylogeny. Unlike previous implementations of ClaDS, which were designed to be used with fixed, user-chosen phylogenies, our package is implemented in the BEAST2 framework and thus allows full phylogenetic inference, where the phylogeny and model parameters are co-estimated from a molecular alignment. Our package provides all necessary components of the inference, including a new tree object and operators to propose moves to the Monte-Carlo Markov chain. It also includes a graphical interface through BEAUti. We validate our implementation of the package by comparing the produced distributions to simulated data and show an empirical example of the full inference, using a dataset of cetaceans.},

                  Many quantitative traits, for example body size, have been hypothesized to influence the diversification dynamics of lineages over macroevolutionary time‐scales. The Quantitative State Speciation‐Extinction (QuaSSE) model and related methods provide an elegant framework for jointly modelling the relationship between change in continuous traits and diversification. However, model misspecification and phylogenetic pseudoreplication can result in elevated false discovery rates in this and other state‐dependent speciation‐extinction models.
                
                
                  Here, we evaluate alternative trait‐dependent diversification methods that do not formally model the relationship between traits and diversification, but instead test for correlations between summary statistics of phylogenetic branching patterns and trait variation at the tips of a phylogenetic tree (hereafter tip‐rate correlations or TRCs). We compare alternative branching pattern statistics and significance tests, and we evaluate their performance relative to QuaSSE under a range of evolutionary scenarios.
                
                
                  
                    We found that a simple statistic derived from branch lengths (inverse equal splits) can detect trait‐associated rate variation, and that a simulation‐based method performs better than phylogenetic generalized least squares for testing the significance of trait‐rate correlations. This test (
                    ES‐sim
                    ) had better power to detect trait‐dependent diversification than other TRCs. By testing the approach across a diverse set of simulation scenarios, we found that
                    ES‐sim
                    is similar to QuaSSE in statistical power. However, the approach rarely led to false inferences of trait‐dependent diversification, even under conditions that are problematic for formal state‐dependent models. We illustrate the application of
                    ES‐sim
                    to real data by re‐assessing the relationship between dispersal ability and diversification in Furnariid birds.
                  
                
                
                  
                    We conclude that simple, semi‐parametric tests like
                    ES‐sim
                    represent a promising approach for trait‐dependent diversification analyses in groups with heterogeneous diversification histories and provide a useful alternative or complement to formal state‐dependent speciation‐extinction models.},

            The rapid diversification and high species richness of flowering plants is regarded as ‘Darwin’s second abominable mystery’. Today the global spatiotemporal pattern of plant diversification remains elusive. Using a newly generated genus-level phylogeny and global distribution data for 14,244 flowering plant genera, we describe the diversification dynamics of angiosperms through space and time. Our analyses show that diversification rates increased throughout the early Cretaceous and then slightly decreased or remained mostly stable until the end of the Cretaceous–Paleogene mass extinction event 66 million years ago. After that, diversification rates increased again towards the present. Younger genera with high diversification rates dominate temperate and dryland regions, whereas old genera with low diversification dominate the tropics. This leads to a negative correlation between spatial patterns of diversification and genus diversity. Our findings suggest that global changes since the Cenozoic shaped the patterns of flowering plant diversity and support an emerging consensus that diversification rates are higher outside the tropics.},
